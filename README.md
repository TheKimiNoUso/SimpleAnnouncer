# SimpleAnnouncer
An extremely simple, powerful, yet easy to use Announcement plugin without the bells and whistles that most plugins on the market add (e.g. useless chat formats, etc.). This is overall pretty lightweight and has a customisable cooldown via config.

## Key Features
- Hexadecimal colour codes supported!
- No hard dependencies, meaning the plugin works 'out of the box'.
- Support for PlaceholderAPI.
- Support for Java 8 or above.
- You can add messages via in-game commands, or by manually editing the config.
- Add as many messages as you like.
- Messages are written completely by you, I intentionally left out a prefix option to make the plugin more customisable.

## Information
An extremely simple and easy to use Announcement plugin without the bells and whistles that most plugins on the market add, making it extremely light-weight. Completely free and support is easily accessible should you have something to suggestion or require help with.

The plugin will send 1 message in chat per cooldown specified by you in your config.yml which can be found in your server files ./plugins/SimpleAnnouncer/config.yml.

Your messages are shuffled in a queue and will not be sent in order; once the queue is empty, it will re-cycle all of your messages back into the queue.
